The following script allows you to:
  * roll more than one dice of different type without any restrictions on the dice size or the number of dice
  * add / subtract
  * multiply / divide

It does not yet allow for:
  * parenthesis syntax
  * non natural values

To do an operation such as increase result by 10% you will have to multiply by 11 and divide by 10
